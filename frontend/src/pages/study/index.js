        <h1>Local Livelihoods - Dairy Farming</h1>
        <h2>Agriculture - Animal Husbandry</h2>
        <p>
          Animal husbandry includes breeding and care of farm animals like cattle, sheep, goats, and ponies. It contributes significantly to the rural economy, providing dairy products, meat, fiber, manure, and employment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dairy farming involves keeping milch animals such as cows, buffaloes, and goats. It plays a crucial role in the nutritional security of agricultural communities. The White Revolution in 1946 organized the dairy sector, especially in Uttarakhand, where the Uttarakhand Cooperative Dairy Federation Limited (UCDFL) and district milk unions promote dairy development.
