      <h1>LOCAL LIVELIHOODS - NATURE GUIDE</h1>
      <h2>ECO-TOURISM</h2>
      <p>
        Eco-tourism, as a concept, is felt differently by various stakeholders. Earlier, the scenic
        beauty and pristine natural areas would attract many tourists, and now, the aim of eco-
        tourism to regulate the flow of tourists according to the carrying capacity of the natural
        area and promote conservation and preservation of ecologically sensitive areas.
        Contemporary ecotourism sector involves an inclusive process which involves
        government, coordinating agencies, private enterprise, and local communities to ensure
        an immersive travel experience entailing natural and cultural experiences. This sector
        addresses the conservation aspects, monitors low impact by the negative visitor and
        provides opportunities to the remotely located local populations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eco-tourism has been put forward in the wake of sustainability dialogues and is
        traditionally defined as, "responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the
        environment and improves the well-being of local inhabitants". It is based on extractive
        tourism, adventure tourism, nature retreats, and wildlife tourism, etc. which combines
        education, recreation, and adventure.
      </p>

      <h2>SECTION 1</h2>
      <h3>DESCRIPTION OF SECTOR</h3>
      <p>
        Nature-guiding is a part of the experience eco-tourism provides. The core on which
        this sector is dependent are natural area destinations, it is ecological importance and
        conservation, respect to local cultures, benefits that local people derive from it, and
        environmental education and awareness. It is mostly a hobby or recreational activity
        which has taken space in knowledge production, livelihood empowerment, and wildlife
        conservation. The most lucrative activities are linked to faunal and avifaunal natural
        bases in which avitourism (birdwatching or birding), butterfly, moth, and wildlife
        sighting are promoted. Under this, the community members are not only participants
        but are involved in the decision-making process.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are conducted during nature walks (day or night) by the local trained experts.
        Uttarakhand has 710 species of birds in diverse ecosystems and geography. The first
        nature-based avitourism was held in the Corbett Tiger Reserve in 1994. In 2012, the
        Uttarakhand forest department started the focus on birdwatching, creation, and
        training of nature guides introduced programs such as the annual state spring bird
        festival. Nature-guiding has given an impetus to local people to learn new skills and
        benefit for making a better livelihood. The opportunities also address the issue of inter-
        state and intra-state (rural to urban) migration.

      <h2>SECTION 3</h2>
      <h3>SCOPE OF THE SUB-SECTO (CURRENT)</h3>
      <p>
        The recent status of nature guiding is in a nascent stage where expert birders are few
        in numbers and are concentrated at mass tourism dominated landscapes such as
        Corbett. Through an interview of Bhim Singh- a birder in Kotabagh (2016), it was
        pointed that the private players who own chains of resorts and hotels are employing
        the expert birdwatchers as guides and are paid well. The sector is still an elite or niche
        tourism where there is lacking interest in education, awareness, wildlife, or avifauna
        census among the visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, efforts by the non-government sector and government departments are
        raising opportunities for local communities but steady growth, monetary returns and
        conservation significance are yet to be observed.
      </p>

      <h3>SCOPE OF THE SUB-SECTO (FUTURE)</h3>
      <p>
        Nature-guiding is emerging as a potential sector if the elements of eco-tourism are well
        placed and monitored in the activities. The elements such as eco-sensitive tourism
        promote the conservation process. Various government steps are pushing towards the
        creation of new and pristine areas for nature-guiding site development, naming a few
        are Asan Conservation Reserve, 2014, Pawalgarh Conservation Reserve, 2015, Asan
        Conservation Reserve, 2016, Nandhaur Wildlife Sanctuary, 2017 and Thano Reserve and
        Jhilmil Jheel Conservation Reserve, 2018. These sites were selected in the last seven
        years to promote Uttarakhand Spring Bird Festival which also assigns trained nature
        guides. Uttarakhand has drafted its eco-tourism policy in 2020 which is yet to be
        launched. A better process streamlining with incentives and opportunities for training
        and jobs can have a fair potential for the sector to grow.
