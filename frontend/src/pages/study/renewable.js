      <h2>RENEWABLE ENERGY</h2>
      <p>
        Renewable energy is defined as energy from sources that are naturally
        replenishable but flow-limited. Uttarakhand is richly endowed with natural
        renewable resources with perennial rivers, forests, and areas with multiple micro-
        climatic zones. The renewable energy potential sources are hydel segment,
        biomass, wind, solar power project, geothermal, and waste to energy-based
        avenues. This potential, if harnessed efficiently, can help to meet the Uttarakhand
        government's goals of rural development, revenue generation, and livelihood
        development. The total cumulative capacity of renewable energy deployed in the
        state with the solar having a maximum share of 45.46% followed by small hydro
        energy and bioenergy with 34.31% and 20.23% respectively. Bioenergy is the most
        abundant source of alternative available which can be converted into fuel sources
        such as electricity, cooking bricks, methane-based applications.
      </p>

      <h2>SECTION 1</h2>
      <p>
        In Uttarakhand, pine needles and other biomass are in abundance. 399329
        hectares of land is covered by chir pine forests which can be harnessed for
        environment-friendly renewable energy resources and add to the socio-
        economic development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pine-needle gasification is a process in which pine needles collected from the
        forest floor undergoes pyrolysis (a thermo-chemical process which converts pine
        needles into gaseous components) to generate electricity and the by-product of
        charcoal is used for cooking purposes. The pine litter is one of the major causes of
        forest fires which results in huge loss to the environment and biodiversity in the
        region, it can meet the energy requirements of the rural community and can
        provide decentralized power supply to agriculture, small industries, and the
        household sector.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generating electricity from renewable resources is backed by the state's
        policywhich targets setting up 50 biomass briquetting plants of a maximum of
        2000 MT per annum capacity by 2030.

      <h2>SECTION 3</h2>
      <h3>SCOPE OF THE SUB-SECTOR (CURRENT)</h3>
      <p>
        The forebearers of pine needle gasification and briquetting who
        hypothesised and tested the results in Uttarakhand is Avani BioEnergy, a
        for-profit social enterprise established in 2011. By 2014, a policy on
        commercialising pine needles using gasification was brought into effect by
        UREDA (Uttarakhand Renewable Energy Development Authority). Avani
        signed an agreement for power purchase with UPCL and influence a
        policy in 2018 which support village-based energy entrepreneurs for
        setting up energy enterprises. As of now, 30 local entrepreneurs are
        incubated in the current scheme who are successfully set up power plants
        of 25kW. In the last six years, technology and the programme have grown.
        The results are evident but slow-moving and are concentrated at one
        organisation and district. UREDA has also called for bidding for selection of
        developers for setting up pine leaves and other biomass-based power
        projects of cumulative capacity 3.940MW through tariff-based competitive
        bidding process under "Policy for Power Generation from Pine Leaves and
        Other Biomass- 2018".
      </p>

      <h3>SCOPE OF THE SUB-SECTOR (FUTURE)</h3>
      <p>
        The future of technology depends on the overall returns of the power
        plants and support from the government. It is an expensive and
        cumbersome technology that requires a large capital investment. The total
        estimated cost of the plant is approximately 25 lakhs INR in which
        NABARD is helping with the loan of 22.5 lakhs INR. A total of 2-3 lacs of
        initial, one-time investment is expected of the developer. There is an
        operation and maintenance cost of approximately 4-5 lakhs annually. If
        successful, the turnover is high with 10-14 lakhs per annum.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the large investment cost can be covered with a strategic mechanism,
        the technology can turn into a high potential option for local
        entrepreneurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dual benefits of the technology are the by-product high coal content
        ash which is bonded to make charcoal bricks and are sold for cooking
        purposes and employment generation for local people for the collection of
        pine needles. The streamlining of locals, government help, and developers
        can create a huge potential market for the pine-needle gasification in
        Uttarakhand.
      </p>

      <h3>POTENTIAL RISKS AND/OR THREATS</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Migration (Loss of skilled manpower and technician)</li>
        <li>Delays at the bureaucratic level.</li>
        <li>Storage space for pine needles</li>
        <li>Moisture content in pine needles</li>
        <li>Losses due to rains</li>
        <li>Transportation</li>
        <li>Changes in ecological habitat and forest floor</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>LOCAL MARKET OR NOT</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Electricity can be sold to local commercial as well as non-commercial
        setup. By-products can replace heavily priced LPG systems in the rural
        parts of Uttarakhand.
