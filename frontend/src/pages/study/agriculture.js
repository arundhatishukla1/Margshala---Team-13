      <h1>LOCAL LIVELIHOODS - DAIRY FARMING</h1>
      <h2>AGRICULTURE - ANIMAL HUSBANDRY</h2>
      <p>
        Animal husbandry is a subset of farm-based livelihoods which includes breeding
        and care of farm animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, ponies, etc. It is referred to as
        livestock raising for commercial purposes to meet the high demands of food.
        Besides being a traditional occupation integral to the functioning and food supply to
        the whole country, it is the major contributor to the rural economy and small and
        marginal or landless farmers. Animal husbandry has four major types- dairy,
        poultry, fish, and beekeeping. It helps the communities by providing dairy products,
        meat, fibre, manure, it diversifies the land and created employment opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dairy farming is the keeping of milch animals which produce milk such as cows,
        buffaloes, and goats. It is also a considerable source for the nutritional security of
        the agricultural communities. The white revolution in 1946 in India opened avenues
        for dairy cooperatives and created an organized dairy sector for production and
        enterprise development. Livestock keeping in Uttarakhand, like the rest of the
        country, is a traditional and important source of livelihood. Since the land parcels
        are a limiting factor in the hills for crop-based agriculture, animal husbandry for
        dairy products is comparatively a more viable option for hill communities. In
        Uttarakhand, the nodal agency for the development of dairy is Uttarakhand Co-
        operative Dairy Federation Limited (UCDFL) and milk unions of the districts.

      <h2>SECTION 3</h2>
      <h3>SCOPE OF THE SUB-SECTOR (CURRENT)</h3>
      <p>
        In Uttarakhand, milk cooperatives have 51,121 members comprising villagers and farmers
        to Aanchal dairy. "Aanchal Dairy"- a flagship milk brand of the state government ensures
        procurement of milk and payments to the members of cooperatives. In 13 districts of the
        state, 2551 village-level cooperatives collected two lakh litres of milk every day till May
        2020 (during lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic). Dairying has been pushed as a
        high potential with the creation of state dairy development board, Uttarakhand Co-
        operative Dairy Federation Limited (UCDFL) and milk unions of the districts. Under current
        initiatives, the dairy department created 11 milk producers SHGs, 10 dairy farms of 2.55
        lakh litres/day capacity, 45 cold chain units of 1.25 lakh litres/day capacity, animal
        feedstock in Rudrapur of 100 metric ton capacity, and added 140 more co-operatives
        making a total of 51,066 dairy members.
      </p>
      <p>Ongoing schemes such as:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Ganga Gaya Yojana (2018) in which 4795 women from low socio-economic groups will
          be given milch cows worth 52,000 INR in which 27000 INR will be state's subsidized,
        </li>
        <li>
          Dugdh Mulya Protsahan Yojana 2018: payments will be given to milk producers and
          they will be interlinked to dairy co-operations.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        At a private level, few of the value addition and milk products-based companies are
        growing in the hills and are enabling dairy farmers to keep more cattle and produce more
        milk. The gap between the hills and plains of Uttarakhand is narrowing with the help of
        entrepreneurship development.
      </p>

      <h3>SCOPE OF THE SUB-SECTOR (FUTURE)</h3>
      <p>
        The growth of the sub-sector is imminent as the consumptive demand for
        the milk and milk-based products are rising with the rise of population. In
        Uttarakhand, most of the houses own more than one cattle head and are
        capable of milching throughout the year. Small scale dairies, enterprises and
        co-operatives are growing throughout the region along with state-owned
        Aanchal. Presently, local breeds are dominant in the hills. The livestock as an
        occupation is diminishing in the hills due to out-migration from the state and
        rural to urban. Lifestyles change and lack of feedstock supply are major
        disablers of dairy farming. Few entrepreneurs ventured into commercial feed
        supply, but the rates of feedstock were not acceptable to the farmers in the
        hills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dairy as a sustenance livelihood will flourish only when pre-requisite of the
        market is met, for example, procurement, feedstock, point of sale, target,
        local as well as intra-interstate sale, mode of payment needs to be
        strategically placed into a profit-making. The schemes are minimal and
        subsidy-based government measures which have average or marginal
        profits. With the support and marketing-based approach, dairy can be a
        viable and high potential option.
      </p>

      <h3>POTENTIAL RISKS/THREATS</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Feedstock unavailability</li>
        <li>Migration</li>
        <li>Lifestyle changes</li>
        <li>Water crisis</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>LOCAL MARKET OR NOT?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. The local market is there for consumptive use and profit-making in the
        local market.
